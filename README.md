# Data Engineering Projects

This repository contains hands-on Data Engineering projects designed to
build strong fundamentals and real-world skills using modern data engineering tools.

The projects follow a structured, project-driven learning approach,
focusing on how data flows through ingestion, transformation, and analytics layers.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Covered

- **Programming:** Python
- **Big Data Processing:** PySpark (Spark DataFrame API & Spark SQL)
- **Querying & Analytics:** SQL
- **Data Engineering Concepts:** Batch pipelines, layered architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
- **Cloud & Platforms:** AWS (S3, Glue/EMR – conceptually), Databricks
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder represents a learning milestone and a practical data engineering use case:

- `01_python_foundations/` – Core Python concepts applied to data ingestion and transformation
- `02_pyspark_basics/` – Introduction to PySpark and Spark SQL
- `03_batch_pipeline_project/` – End-to-end batch data pipeline using Python, PySpark, and SQL
- `04_advanced_pyspark/` – Advanced transformations, joins, and window functions

## 🎯 Learning Approach

- Learn concepts through real projects, not isolated exercises
- Emphasis on clean, modular, and readable code
- Gradual progression from Python → PySpark → SQL-based transformations
- Focus on practical data engineering scenarios

This repository reflects continuous learning, improvement, and hands-on practice
in data engineering.
